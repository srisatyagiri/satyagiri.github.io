## About Us

The Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple, established by the Sreepada Family Trust on February 22, 2002, serves as a vibrant center for Sanatana Dharma, the eternal principles of Hinduism. Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding and practice of these principles through cultural, social, spiritual, and religious services, welcoming individuals from all walks of life.

## Sanatana Dharma: The Foundation of Our Temple

Sanatana Dharma, often referred to as Hinduism, is a rich and diverse tradition that emphasizes the pursuit of truth, righteousness (dharma), and spiritual liberation (moksha). It encompasses a wide spectrum of philosophies, rituals, and practices, all aimed at fostering a harmonious relationship between the individual, society, and the divine.

Central to Hindu culture is the concept of *dharma*, the inherent duty and ethical code that guides our actions. It emphasizes the importance of compassion, truthfulness, non-violence (ahimsa), and selfless service (seva). Through our temple's activities, we strive to embody these principles and inspire our community to do the same.

## A Place of Divine Presence and Community**

Our temple is a sacred space where devotees can connect with the divine and experience the profound peace and tranquility that comes from spiritual practice. We offer a variety of services, including:

* **Daily Pujas and Aartis:** Offering prayers and devotional hymns to the deities.
* **Festivals and Celebrations:** Observing and celebrating the rich tapestry of Hindu festivals, fostering a sense of community and shared tradition.
* **Spiritual Discourses and Workshops:** Providing opportunities for learning and reflection on Hindu scriptures and philosophy.
